# Genshin-Impact Database/Dashboard

The current database (GI_auto.db) is still a prototype and will be edited whenever possible to add the new Characters, Weapon and Artifacts whenever they are announced
The stats also will be updated accordingly.

Feel free to tell me if you have any ideas that would help me improve the database.

I added a visualisation using tableau Public (The Free Version) and since the free version doesn't offer a connection to sqlite, I had to export the database as csv and then convert it to excel to be able to import it to Tableau Public.

#Note
In order to open the dashboard or try to use it you have to either access it through Tableau Public : (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aniss.guechtouli/viz/GenshinDshB/Tableaudebord1)
Or download the file and download Tableau Public.
